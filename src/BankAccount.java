  Now suppose two threads try to withdraw â‚¹700 at the same time:

Both read balance as â‚¹1000.

Both think thereâ€™s enough money.

Both subtract â‚¹700 â†’ final balance becomes â‚¹300 instead of â‚¹100 or -â‚¹400.

ðŸ‘‰ This is a race condition because multiple threads are reading/writing the same balance without synchronization.
